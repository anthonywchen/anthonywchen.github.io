	<h5>
		In this task, you are given a passage, a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.<br /><br />
		The task is to <font color="#FF0000"><em>score how closely a predicted answer captures the same information (i.e. have the same meaning) as a correct answer</em></font> using the <em><strong><u>passage</u></strong></em>, <em><strong><u>question</u></strong></em>, and human <em><strong><u>commonsense knowledge</u></strong></em>. 


		<br /> <br /> 
		Scoring is on a scale <font color="#FF0000"><em> from 1 to 5 </em></font>. 
		<br />
		
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>1</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures none of the information of the correct answer, and thus is a completely wrong answer.
		<br /> 
		
		A <font color="#FF0000"><em>5</em></font> score means the predicted answer captures the same information as the correct answer, and thus is a completely right answer.

		<br /><br /><br />

		<u>Note:</u> A predicted answer may answer the question correctly, but to be given a score of 5, <font color="#FF0000;"><b>it must be equivalent to the correct answer</b></font>.<br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> The score you give should not depend on the capitalization of the correct and predicted answer.<br/><br/>
		<u>Note:</u> A helpful tip for searching for the correct answer in the passage is using Control+F to search for it.<br/><br/>

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">5</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 5.

		<ul>
			<li> It is clear that that the predicted and correct answers refer to the same person, place, or object.</li>
			<li> The predicted and correct answers are synonyms. </li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I noticed my alarm clock had stopped working. I removed the old batteries by lifting them up, then I placed the new batteries in the same position. <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Who changed the batteries in the clock? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The speaker <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  the narrator <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The speaker refers to the same person as the narrator. More generally, if the correct answer and the predicted answer both refer to the same entity, then the predicted answer is correct, even if it is written differently. <br />
		</div><br />

			<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> &hellip;I heated up a frying pan with a little butter in it. Once the pan was hot, I poured my eggs in it&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What were the eggs cooked in? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The eggs were cooked in a pan. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> a frying pan  <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> As stated in the passage, the pan is indeed a frying pan. Therefore, the predicted answer matches the correct answer. The correct answer also has the phrase "the eggs were cooked in", however, this part is stated in the question and is not necessary to have in the predicted answer.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> We chose not to make any new food, because we could still eat the leftover food. We took put it into a pan, and put that pan on the stove&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Were they heating leftovers? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Yes they were reheating leftovers. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> yes  <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer of "yes" is sufficient to answer the question and match the predicted answer. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">

			<strong>Passage:</strong> We went to the mall and decided to split up and meet up two hours later. After we met back up, we ate some ice cream before we left&hellip;<br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How long did they spend there? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Three hours, because they shared ice cream after shopping <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> a few hours <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> We say that "a few hours" is similar enough to "three hours" since "few" generally includes "3". The predicted answer does not need to include "because they shared ice cream after shopping" because the question did not ask for a reason.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I was getting ready to set the alarm when I realized that's the batteries were dead and needed to be changed&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> when did they change the battery? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> When the clock did not work. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  When they realized the batteries were dead <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The clock not working is essentially the same event as the batteries dying. We therefore say this predicted answer is completely correct.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">4</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 4 means a predicted answer is perfect with a minor detail wrong. Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 4.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted answer is a little ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer is a <strong>little</strong> unspecific (e.g. the correct answer is the city but the predicted answer is the country of the city).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the gender wrong (e.g. he vs she, him vs her).</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the plurality wrong (e.g. he vs they, policeman vs policemen).</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I went to the train station early, so I picked a spot on a bench and sat down. After a short while, everybody lined up to get on the train&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How long did they wait at the station? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> a short while <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  a few minutes <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> A few minutes is a near perfect answer. However, the predicted answer says a "short while", which is broad enough that it could be interpreted as anytime from a few minutes to 30 minutes. We therefore give this predicted answer a <strong>4</strong> for not completely matching the correct answer. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> We wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean.  We got out glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What cleaning products did they use? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Glass and toilet bowl cleaners. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  glass cleaner , toilet cleaner , toilet cleaner <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer lists all the items in the correct answer, however, it repeats the "toilet cleaner" item. Because the predicted answer is correct but is a little repetitive, we give it a <strong>4</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Half Right)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">3</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		Some ways a predicted answer can get a score of 3.
		<ul>
			<li> The prediction gets the details right, but is quite unspecific (see example 2) </li>
			<li> The prediction gets half of the details right (see example 3). </li>
			<li> The correct answer is a list but the prediction only gets some of the elements of the list.</li>
			<li> The correct answer is a single item (person, object, etc) but the prediction adds some extra items.</li>
			<li> The predicted answer gets the first name right but the last name wrong (or vice versa).</li>
		</ul>
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and added small pieces of wood to it&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What did they use for fuel? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Wood <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  Newspaper and wood <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> In cases where the correct answer is a noun or a list of nouns and the predicted answer either adds extra items or misses some of them, we generally give it a 3.  <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> What event are they looking forward to most? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> New Year's Eve. <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  celebrating an annual holiday <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While New Year's Eve is an annual holiday, it is too vague, as there are many holidays. We therefore give it a <strong>3</strong> <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I wanted to spruce up my house. I had three paintings of plumeria flowers waiting to be hung on the wall&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> what kind of art is it? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong>  Paintings of flowers<br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  plumeria flowers <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the fact that art is of flowers correct. However, it doesn't describe the <i>kind</i> of art (painting). We therefore consider this answer half correct. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I was reading when the light went out. It looked like that light bulb had burned out. I went to the hall closet and found a package of light bulbs&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Where did they get the light bulb? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> From the hall closet <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> the living closet <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer gets the fact that location is a closet. However, the closet type is wrong. A living closet (whatever that is) is not the same as a hall closet. Therefore, the prediction is half correct.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Mostly Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">2</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		A score of 2 means that the predicted answer is incorrect, but there is some slight redeemable quality to it.
		<ul>
			<li> The predicted is <b>very</b> unspecific (see example 1).</li>
			<li> The prediction gets some detail correct, but more than one thing wrong and/or is highly ungrammatical. </li>
			<li> The predicted gets a detail wrong that significantly affects the meaning, but still gets some minor details correct.</li>
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I needed to clean up my flat. I had to get my broom and vacuum. I used the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Where did they vacuum? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Rooms with rugs and carpet <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong>  in the flat <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While the rooms with rugs and carpet are technically in the flat, the predicted answer needs to be much more specific and say which rooms. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> My family decide to go to the beach. We packed some snacks. We packed a cooler with all our drinks and water&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> How did they keep lunch cold?<br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> probably with a cooler <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> yes , they put a cooler <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer includes the term "cooler" which is good. However, the word "yes" is unnecessary and "they put a cooler" is ungrammatical and doesn't make much sense. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> I like to stay in touch with family and friends. We stay in touch by texting but we like to hear each others voices so we often call&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why does that person like to call?  <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> To catch up with family and friends <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> it was to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk to talk <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer not only rambles, but it misses the important detail of talking to family and friends. However, "to talk" is the same as "to catch up" in this context, so we will say the predicted is not completely wrong and give it a <strong>2</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

	<h4><strong><font color="blue">(Completely Wrong)</font> Predicted answers that should recieve a <font color="red">1</font>:</strong><br /></h4>
		<div style="padding-left: .1em; border:solid #000; border-width: 1px;">&nbsp;
		There are a number of ways a predicted answer can get a score of 1.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>TRICKY!!!</strong> A predicted answer can technically be a correct answer to the question, but if it does not have the same meaning as the correct answer, it is a score of 1 for this task. (see example 1) </li>
			<li> The predicted doesn't make any sense and/or is very ungrammatical.</li>
			<li> The answer gets all details wrong (e..g the name(s) are completely wrong, places are completely wrong, etc). </li>
			<li> The predicted answer is opposite of the correct answer (e.g. yes vs no, hot vs cold, etc.)
		</ul> 
		</div>&nbsp;

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire. &hellip; We lit the fire and began to cook so everything would be ready for our guests once they arrived. <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why did they have a bonfire? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> to have a family gathering <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> to cook everything <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> While "to cook everything" is technically a correct answer to the question, for a predicted answer to be "right" in this task, it must also be EQUIVALENT (have the same meaning) to the correct answer. "to cook everything" is a completely different from "to have a family gathering". We therefore score the predicted answer a <strong>1</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> It was a cool spring evening and we wanted to have a family get together on the beach around a bonfire&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why did they have a bonfire?  <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> to have a family gathering <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> to have a family <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer has a lot of words in common with the the correct answer. However, it is more important to focus on the meaning. "Having a family", is completely different than "having a family gathering", so this gets a <strong>1</strong>.<br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> Tom needed to go to work. Unfortunately, his car would not start. He then looked online to find a taxi&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> When did they get on the taxi ? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Morning <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> in the destination minutes  <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> The predicted answer doesn't make sense and isn't grammatical. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> We were excited about the awesome new mall and planned all week to visit it this past weekend!&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> When did they go to the shopping centre? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> last weekend <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> this weekend <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> Last weekend and this weekend have different meanings. <br />
		</div><br />

		<div style="padding-left: 3em;">
			<strong>Passage:</strong> My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married&hellip; <br />
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why are they going to the destination? <br />
			<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> friends wedding <br />
			<strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> to married <br />
			<strong><font color="purple">Justification:</font></strong> "to married" is ungrammatical. Also, it seems like the predicted answer is implying the narrator is getting married, which is wrong.<br />

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef.  When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like.  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder.  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me.  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes.  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts.  It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through.  While I set the table, I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">My wife invited some friends over yesterday to watch one of their favorite foods.  Because we were going to have guests over, we wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean in case they needed to use it.  To clean the bathroom, we got out the cleaning supplies from the closet.  We got out glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber.  We took turns washing the mirrors in the bathroom, organizing the counter, and then cleaning the toilet.  I was the one assigned to do that, of course.  I made sure that there wasn't any dirt or gross things on the toilet.  I poured the toilet bowl cleaner into the bowl and scrubbed it all over the toilet.  After I did that, I got the paper towels and made sure that I cleaned up all the wet stuff that was left over on the toilet and the seat.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Last night after dinner, I had "dishwasher duty." That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher. After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher. I unloaded the bottom rack first. That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes. The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it. After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips. I then put all of the dishes back into the original cupboard places that they came from. That means that I put my plates in the cupboard near my sink, and I put my cups in the cupboard near my fridge. Lastly, I put my utensils and bowls in a cupboard near the microwave.</p>

			<h4><strong>Part 1. Read the following passage: </strong></h4>
			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them.</p>

I started by going around and picking up any garbage I seem, like used candy wrappers and old bottles of water.I threw them away. I went around and picked up and dishes that were out and put them in the sink then washed them. I used my broom to sweep up all the dust and dirt off the floors the hard floors, and the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets. When the hard floors were swept, I used a bucket with floor cleaner and water, and a mop, to mop them up. As the dried I took a rag and began dusting everything in the room. The t.v., the tables and counters and everything else that was a hard surface, I used the rag to dust. My flat looked very nice when it was clean.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">I walk into the kitchen. I am hungry. It is still early in the morning, so breakfast would be appropriate. Eggs should do it. I open my refrigerator and grab 1 egg. I look in my cabinets and also grab a small pan. I put the pan on the stove and turn the knob on the side of the stove until the gas lights underneath my pan. I keep the fire low. While this heats up, I grab some butter from my refrigerator. I also get a spatula from my kitchen drawer. I scoop some butter out of the container with my spatula, then transfer the butter to the small pan. The butter begins to melt on the stove top. It is time to crack my egg and begin cooking. I crack my egg lightly on the counter top until the contents begin to ooze. I position my egg over the small pan and break the egg into two pieces, so that the egg lands on the small pan. I crack the yolk with my spatula. I then wait 3 minutes while the egg cooks. I sprinkle salt and pepper over the egg. When it is time, I flip the egg and repeat the process. When it is done, I remove the egg from the pan with my spatula and put the egg on a plate. It is time to eat.</p>

			<p style="font-size: 12pt;font-family:Verdana;color: black;">Last night, my friends and I wanted to make a bonfire. So, we made sure that we had some fire wood. We went to the back of her yard and gathered up some dry wood. My friend reminded us that the wood had to be dry, or else it would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked the wood into the fire pit, my friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light the wood. It took a few tries, but the wood finally caught on fire, and we were able to start our bonfire. As the fire continued to burn, we added more wood or newspaper to keep the fire burning. We all had a fun time sitting around the fire and talking.</p>

So I took the battery cover off of the bottom of the alarm clock, which is where I saw the the two dead AA batteries. I took the batteries out, one by one, and through the old batteries in the garbage. I then opened a brand-new store-bought pack of AA batteries, and removed two of them from the packaging. Following the direct actions within the battery compartment of the alarm clock, I inserted each of the batteries one by one, ensuring that the positive and negative terminals were facing in the correct directions. Once both batteries were in place and snugly intact, I put the battery cover back on the bottom of the alarm clock in order to secure the batteries in place. I then turned over the clock so that it was sitting right side up and facing me. I push the power button and the face of the clock lit up, with 12 o'clock blinking in red.</p>
