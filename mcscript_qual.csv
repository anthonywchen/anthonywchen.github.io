mcscript_qual,"Sometimes for dinner I like to have fish instead of chicken or beef.  When I want to have fish for dinner I will go to my local fish market and pick out something I like.  Some times it might be salmon, sometimes tuna, or maybe a white fish like tilapia or flounder.  I will buy a pound of it, and the fish monger will wrap it in wax paper and put it in a bag for me.  Once I have it home, I check it, finding it clean and not smelling at all like fish.  I will put it in a glass casserole dish and season it with salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, vinegar and olive oil.  I might put a few onions in with it.  I will turn on the oven and while the oven gets hot I will make a salad.  Once the oven is hot I will put the fish inside and set a timer.  While the fish bakes, I will make other side dishes.  When the timer rings I know its done and I carefully take it out with oven mitts.  It smells so good of garlic and its nice and cooked through.  While I set the table, I let it cool and after a few minutes I serve my self a piece and my salad and side dishes.",How did they cook the fish?,Baked,"yes , they put it in the oven",-,1,"My wife invited some friends over yesterday to watch one of their favorite foods.  Because we were going to have guests over, we wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean in case they needed to use it.  To clean the bathroom, we got out the cleaning supplies from the closet.  We got out glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber.  We took turns washing the mirrors in the bathroom, organizing the counter, and then cleaning the toilet.  I was the one assigned to do that, of course.  I made sure that there wasn't any dirt or gross things on the toilet.  I poured the toilet bowl cleaner into the bowl and scrubbed it all over the toilet.  After I did that, I got the paper towels and made sure that I cleaned up all the wet stuff that was left over on the toilet and the seat.",What tools did they use to clean the bathroom?,"Glass cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, paper towels, and a scrubber","glass cleaner , toilet cleaner",-,2,"Last night after dinner, I had ""dishwasher duty."" That means that it was my turn to do the dishes and unload the dishwasher. After the dishwasher had washed the dishes, I first opened the door to the dishwasher. I unloaded the bottom rack first. That way, if any water drips or leftover food were stuck on the dishes still, they wouldn't trickle down to my clean dishes. The bottom drawer usually has my plates in it. After unloading the bottom drawer, I unloaded the top drawer, which usually contains my cups, utensils, and my bowls. I use a towel to dry off any leftover water drips. I then put all of the dishes back into the original cupboard places that they came from. That means that I put my plates in the cupboard near my sink, and I put my cups in the cupboard near my fridge. Lastly, I put my utensils and bowls in a cupboard near the microwave.",When did they open the dishwasher?,After the dishwasher washed the dishes,last night after dinner,-,3,I was at camp and getting ready to lead a workshop teaching cooking on a campfire. Luckily it had not rained for a few days so all the wood in the area was dry. I had some large logs that were sitting by the fire ring so I went searching for some smaller sticks and kindling. I built a log cabin structure out of the larger logs. Inside the log cabin structure I put some very small tinder as well as some balled up pieces of newspaper. I lit the newspaper and continued adding very small pieces of wood to it. When the small pieces started catching I started adding larger twigs. As smaller pieces started catching on fire I kept added larger and larger twigs and sticks until the big logs started burning. I continued to add sticks so I could get a nice sized fire burning that would create lots of hot coals so we could cook on them.,who lit the fire,the teacher,the narrator,-,4,"I needed to clean up my flat. I had to get my broom and vacuum and all the cleaners I would need. I started by going around and picking up any garbage I seem, like used candy wrappers and old bottles of water.I threw them away.

I used my broom to sweep up all the dust and dirt off the floors the hard floors, and the vacuum to clean up the floors that had rugs and carpets. When the hard floors were swept, I used a bucket with floor cleaner and water, and a mop, to mop them up. As the dried I took a rag and began dusting everything in the room.

It is still early in the morning, so breakfast would be appropriate. Eggs should do it. I open my refrigerator and grab 1 egg. I look in my cabinets and also grab a small pan. I put the pan on the stove and turn the knob on the side of the stove until the gas lights underneath my pan. I keep the fire low. While this heats up, I grab some butter from my refrigerator. I also get a spatula from my kitchen drawer. I scoop some butter out of the container with my spatula, then transfer the butter to the small pan. The butter begins to melt on the stove top. It is time to crack my egg and begin cooking. I crack my egg lightly on the counter top until the contents begin to ooze. I position my egg over the small pan and break the egg into two pieces, so that the egg lands on the small pan. I crack the yolk with my spatula. I then wait 3 minutes while the egg cooks. I sprinkle salt and pepper over the egg. When it is time, I flip the egg and repeat the process. When it is done, I remove the egg from the pan with my spatula and put the egg on a plate.

So, we made sure that we had some fire wood. We went to the back of her yard and gathered up some dry wood. My friend reminded us that the wood had to be dry, or else it would not burn very well. Next, we all helped out by placing the chunks of wood into the fire pit. Once we stacked the wood into the fire pit, my friend grabbed a lighter and lighter fluid. My friend poured some of the lighter fluid out onto the wood, and then used the lighter to light the wood. It took a few tries, but the wood finally caught on fire, and we were able to start our bonfire. As the fire continued to burn, we added more wood or newspaper to keep the fire burning.

So I took the battery cover off of the bottom of the alarm clock, which is where I saw the the two dead AA batteries. I took the batteries out, one by one, and through the old batteries in the garbage. I then opened a brand-new store-bought pack of AA batteries, and removed two of them from the packaging. Following the direct actions within the battery compartment of the alarm clock, I inserted each of the batteries one by one, ensuring that the positive and negative terminals were facing in the correct directions. Once both batteries were in place and snugly intact, I put the battery cover back on the bottom of the alarm clock in order to secure the batteries in place. I then turned over the clock so that it was sitting right side up and facing me. I push the power button and the face of the clock lit up, with 12 o'clock blinking in red.",Did they need to go to the store to buy the batteries?,No they didn't,No.,-,9,"I wanted to watch a movie and decided to rent one form a store video rental.
